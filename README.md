## Overview
This project is a simple traffic simulation program implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It simulates vehicles moving through an intersection controlled by traffic signals.

### Features
- Simulation of vehicles moving through an intersection
- Traffic signals controlling vehicle movement
- Generation of vehicles at random lanes and directions
- Basic user interface for visualization
