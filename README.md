## Overview
This project is a simple traffic simulation program implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It simulates vehicles moving through an intersection controlled by traffic signals.

### Features
- Simulation of vehicles moving through an intersection
- Traffic signals controlling vehicle movement
- Generation of vehicles at random lanes and directions
- Basic user interface for visualization

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SSK0414/Traffic-Simulator-in-Python

2. Install Pygame library:
```sh
   pip install pygame
```
3. Unzip Images:

4. Make sure the folders are in the same parent directory

#### Usage
1. Navigate:
```sh
   cd Traffic-Simulator-in-Python
```
2. Run the Simulation:
```sh
   python simulation.py
```
## Structure
